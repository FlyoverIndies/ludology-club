# Trial and Error

## General Notes

What is trial and error?

- play again and again
- discover the pattern
- developing and testing a hypothesis is not the same as predicting the solution
- the same action will always yield the same result, try something different

When is it fun? When is it too hard?

- controls/execution errors, compared to feeling like "it's the game's fault"
- getting to play again faster after failure, see Celeste and Super Meat Boy
- when the time investment is high and having to start over, see Getting Over It

How to make trial and error accessible/minimize frustration?

- adjust pacing, slow things down
- more/unlimited resources (like stamina), see Celeste
- additional checkpoints, opportunities to save progress
- variable difficulty modes: easy vs expert or new game plus

Essentials for cues/feedback when designing challenges

- obviously possible
- apparently impossible
- remember new vs seasoned audiences, varying levels of game literacy

On the subject of trial and error and how they relate specifically to different games:

- Please Dont Touch Anything is all about pushing buttons to find out what they do. Point and click adventure games like MYST, the Secret of Monkey Island and Full Throttle do similar things while having a bigger area to explore, although sometimes having more obtuse solutions
- Baba is You lets you poke around with how things interact with each other, as opposed to just interacting with things like in other puzzle games
- Zaga 33 is a roguelike with different items, but the sprite of the items is randomized with each run. taps into the complete randomness of card-matching and minesweeper
- Celeste and other modern tough-as-nails platformers like Super Meat Boy have super quick respawns and frequent checkpoints, so you only have to try until you get it right once
- Minit captures this too, featuring it as the core mechanic with thoughtful puzzle based challenges instead of dexterity based challenges
- Trap Adventure 2 also captures this, but with comedic payoffs through reversals in each room. this comedy comes at the expense that the levels are always trying to trick you and its usually not the players fault when they fail getting through a room
- Getting Over It and Jump King go differently with the idea, by punishing the player with having to redo sections they've already done if they fall, while still being straightforward about the mechanics and making it feel like the players fault if they fall, as opposed to the games fault
- the Legend of Zelda (NES), Dark Souls, and FEZ were designed to lean so heavily on trial and error based that you have to have a community helping you through it, culminating in Dark Souls' in-game message systems
- Dark Souls, along with Below, use the idea of figuring things out to build mystery, by throwing the player straight into this world with no idea what's gonna happen
- Portal games had great trial and error puzzles that gave the player just enough info to get through the puzzles. also introduced mechanics extremely well in both games

_Minor spoilers for the Beginners Guide below_

- skipping the spooky maze at the end of Beginners Guide is a symbolic interaction about trial and error and hiding themselves and making a point by making itself inaccessible
